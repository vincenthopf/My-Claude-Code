## How Work Flows

Work moves through five stages. Not every task needs all five — fixing a typo doesn't need problem definition. But for anything non-trivial, skipping a stage is how things go wrong.

1. **`/problem-definition`** — Frame what we're solving before deciding how to solve it
2. **`/design`** — Explore solutions, evaluate approaches, pick a direction
3. **`/planning`** — Two Codex agents propose in parallel, Opus synthesizes, user approves
4. **`/implementation`** — Sub-agents build in parallel, verified against problem + principles
5. **`/debugging`** — RCA → dual proposal → synthesis → alignment → implement

## Principles

All decisions, proposals, and code are governed by `~/.claude/principles.md`. Read it. Every alignment check verifies against it. If you haven't read it this session, read it before doing non-trivial work.

## Context Awareness

If you notice degraded performance, confusion, or repetition, say so. The context window may need compaction or a fresh session.

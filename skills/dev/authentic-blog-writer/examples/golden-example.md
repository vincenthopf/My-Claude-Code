This post demonstrates the target voice for the authentic-blog-writer skill. Study the patterns.

## What Makes This Work

### Opening: Direct + Personal

> In this guide I will break down how I went about setting up my own private email domain using Proton, how to start receiving emails from your custom address and importantly how to get emails sent from your custom address as well.

**Why it works:**
- "I will break down how I went about" - personal, active voice
- Lists exactly what reader will learn - no fluff
- "importantly" - shows opinion, not neutral

### Honest Caveats with Humor

> Migrating your email is not for everyone so there are a few things to consider before getting started:
>
> You will never get those 20 seconds of your life back from reading this terrible disclaimer. But it is important that you know that in all likelihood you are going to miss something when migrating your email address.

**Why it works:**
- Self-deprecating: "terrible disclaimer"
- Upfront about downsides: "you are going to miss something"
- Humor doesn't undermine the actual warning

### Admitting Real Limitations

> Personally I have missed a few services still sending to my old address, and it is likely that at some point I'll no longer be able to receive those emails. However in the scheme of things I don't feel like those are important enough to have put off making the switch.

**Why it works:**
- "Personally I have missed" - admits real failure
- Provides practical perspective on the tradeoff
- Doesn't pretend the solution is perfect

### Strategic Imperfection

> The process should be relatively simple to follow, but I do not guarantee this will work on Windows, it gets janky, but the end result is something I'm quite proud of.

**Why it works:**
- "should be relatively simple" - hedges appropriately (not excessively)
- "I do not guarantee" - honest disclaimer
- "it gets janky" - authentic admission
- "something I'm quite proud of" - personal investment shows through

## Contrast: How NOT to Write This

**Bad version:**
> In today's digital landscape, email privacy has become increasingly important. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of setting up a custom domain with Proton Mail. By following these steps, you'll be able to leverage Proton's enterprise-grade security features to optimize your email infrastructure.

**What went wrong:**
- "In today's digital landscape" - generic opener
- "comprehensive guide" - corporate speak
- "leverage" and "optimize" - jargon
- "enterprise-grade" - marketing language
- No personality, no personal stake, no honest caveats
